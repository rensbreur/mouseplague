This app allows your Mac to use each connected mouse or trackpad seperately with its own screen cursor.

On macOS 10.15 and higher, mouseplague requires the "Input Monitoring" and "Accessibility" permissions.

### Limitations
* Dragging and mouse-over functionality does not work with any secondary mouse.
* The MacBook internal trackpad has a delay and haptic feedback does not work if it is used as a secondary mouse.
